# Integrate Google Calendar Events with Google Sheets Using Apps Script

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and integrating Google Calendar events directly from a Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. Even if you're new to this, don't worryâ€”this guide is designed for beginners with little to no programming experience.

## Prerequisites

- **Google Account**: You'll need to be signed into your Google account.
- **Google Calendar Access**: Ensure you have access to the Google Calendar where you want to add events.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create a New Google Spreadsheet

- Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) and click on **Blank** to create a new spreadsheet.

### 2. Set Up Your Spreadsheet

- **Rename the Spreadsheet**: Click on the default title `Untitled spreadsheet` at the top-left corner and name it something like `Calendar Events Creator`.
- **Create Headers**: In the first row of the spreadsheet, enter the following headers:
  - Cell A1: `Title`
  - Cell B1: `Description`
  - Cell C1: `Location`
  - Cell D1: `Start Date & Time`
  - Cell E1: `End Date & Time`

### 3. Open the Apps Script Editor

- In your spreadsheet, click on the **Extensions** tab in the menu bar.
- Select **Apps Script** from the dropdown. This will open a new tab with the Apps Script editor.

### 4. Write the Apps Script Code

- **Delete Placeholder Code**: If there's any default code in the editor (`function myFunction() {}`), you can remove it.
- **Copy and Paste the Following Code**:

  ```javascript
  function createCalendarEvents() {
    var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
    var startRow = 2; // First row of data to process
    var numRows = sheet.getLastRow() - 1; // Number of rows to process
    var dataRange = sheet.getRange(startRow, 1, numRows, 5);
    var data = dataRange.getValues();

    for (var i = 0; i < data.length; ++i) {
      var row = data[i];
      var title = row[0];
      var description = row[1];
      var location = row[2];
      var startTime = new Date(row[3]);
      var endTime = new Date(row[4]);

      var event = {
        'summary': title,
        'description': description,
        'location': location,
        'start': {
          'dateTime': startTime.toISOString()
        },
        'end': {
          'dateTime': endTime.toISOString()
        }
      };

      CalendarApp.getDefaultCalendar().createEvent(title, startTime, endTime, {description: description, location: location});
    }
    SpreadsheetApp.getUi().alert('Events have been added to your calendar!');
  }
  ```

### 5. Save Your Script

- Click on the floppy disk icon ðŸ’¾ or press **Ctrl+S** (Windows) or **Cmd+S** (Mac) to save your script.
- Name your project by clicking on `Untitled project` at the top-left and entering a name like `CalendarEventScript`.

### 6. Enable Required APIs

- **Permissions**: The first time you run the script, you'll need to grant it permission to access your calendar.
- **Enable Calendar API**:
  - In the Apps Script editor, click on the **Services** icon (it looks like a "+" symbol in a shield).
  - In the dialog, find and select **Calendar API**.
  - Click **Add**.

### 7. Run the Script

- Click on the drop-down menu beside the run button (triangle icon) and ensure `createCalendarEvents` is selected.
- Click the **Run** button.
- **Authorize the Script**:
  - A dialog will appear requesting authorization.
  - Click **Review Permissions**.
  - Choose your Google account.
  - You might see a warning saying "This app isn't verified".
  - Click on **Advanced** and then **Go to CalendarEventScript (unsafe)**.
  - Click **Allow** to grant the necessary permissions.

### 8. Enter Your Event Details

- Go back to your Google Spreadsheet.
- Starting from row 2, enter the event details under the respective headers.
  - **Title**: Name of the event.
  - **Description**: Details about the event.
  - **Location**: Where the event will take place.
  - **Start Date & Time**: When the event starts. *(Format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS)*
  - **End Date & Time**: When the event ends. *(Format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS)*

  **Example**:

  | Title          | Description        | Location      | Start Date & Time   | End Date & Time     |
  |----------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
  | Team Meeting   | Discuss Q4 targets | Conference Rm | 11/15/2023 10:00:00 | 11/15/2023 11:00:00 |

### 9. Run the Script Again

- After entering your event details, run the script again by clicking the **Run** button in the Apps Script editor.
- A message should appear saying "Events have been added to your calendar!"

### 10. Verify Events in Google Calendar

- Go to your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com).
- Check the dates and times of the events you added to see if they appear correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Script Errors**: If you encounter errors when running the script, ensure that:
  - All date and time entries are in the correct format.
  - You have granted all necessary permissions.
- **Events Not Appearing**: Double-check that you're looking at the correct calendar associated with your Google account.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a Google Apps Script that adds events from a Google Sheet to your Google Calendar. This tool can save you time, especially when dealing with multiple events.

### What's Next?

- **Customize the Script**: Modify the script to add more functionalities, like sending email reminders.
- **Share with Others**: This tool can be shared with colleagues who might benefit from it.
- **Explore Apps Script**: Delve deeper into Google Apps Script to automate other tasks in Google Workspace.
